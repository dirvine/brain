🎯 Discovery: Arithmetic progression with difference 4.000
   Pattern: a_n = 3 + 4 * n
   Confidence: 100.0%
   Supporting cases: 6
```

#### Automated Theorem Proving
```
🔍 Proof: For any integer n, n³ - n is always divisible by 6

📜 Proof Steps:
1. Let n be any integer. We want to show 6 | (n³ - n)
2. n³ - n = n(n² - 1) = n(n-1)(n+1) (Factoring)
3. n(n-1)(n+1) is the product of three consecutive integers
4. Among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3
5. Among any three consecutive integers, at least one is even
6. Therefore n(n-1)(n+1) is divisible by both 2 and 3, hence by 6

✅ Proof Result: Successful (100.0% confidence, 6 steps)
