**Example Automated Proof:**
```
üîç Proof: n¬≥ - n is divisible by 6 for all integers n

üìú Proof Steps:
1. Let n be any integer. We want to show 6 | (n¬≥ - n)
2. n¬≥ - n = n(n¬≤ - 1) = n(n-1)(n+1) (Factoring)
3. n(n-1)(n+1) is the product of three consecutive integers
4. Among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3
5. Among any three consecutive integers, at least one is even
6. Therefore n(n-1)(n+1) is divisible by both 2 and 3, hence by 6

‚úÖ Proof Result: Successful (100.0% confidence, 6 steps)
